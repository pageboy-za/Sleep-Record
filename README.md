Sleep-Record
============

This is a basic attempt by me to learn some **Objective-C** basics on iOS, to help me better understand the issues the development community I work with in the office will go through.  

The basic Idea for the app is to run while the phone is charging next to or in bed and at periodic intervals check for sounds if there are raised sound levels to record these to solve that age old marital debate about whether or not I snore.

As a secondary input the app will respond to accelerometer inputs shortcut the periodic timer.  This way you could elbow the bed instead of your partners ribs to begin recording the evidence of them snoring.
